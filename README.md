##Usage##
* cd build
* cmake ..

Then, all our tests implemented will be compiled, and directly executabled in your terminal :
* ./"test_name"

### Final results ###
To see our final results, after all executables been generated, exectute "final_philips" or "final_gerstner", you will be able to see our implementation of both models mentionned in the subject.


Tests results are often redirected to "*.txt" files, wich will be placed in the build folder.

##Informations##
*All of the source code is located in the "src" folder.
* You can modify the tests as you wish, just make sure to recompile it after your modifications.
* For example, you may want to play with the different waves' parameters to see how it impacts the ocean' surface.
